# GPT-Wrapper

Every time I need to use ChatGPT's API, I need to write the same code, and this is annoying. So, I'd like to write this wrapper. This is a Python wrapper for OpenAI's GPT models. It is easy to use for research and development.

This readme file is partially generated by AI, since writing a readme file is also annoying.

## Features

- Multimodal Support: Send both text and images to GPT models like GPT-4o
- Structured Responses: Get typed, structured responses using Pydantic models
- Cost Tracking: Monitor token usage and associated costs
- Simple API: Clean, intuitive interface for sending prompts and handling responses

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use GPT-4o to recognize objects in an image:

1. Create a `.env.sh` file with your OpenAI credentials:

```bash
API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

2. Source the `.env.sh` file:

```bash
source .env.sh
```

3. Use the wrapper:

```python
from gptwrapper import GPTWrapper

# Initialize wrapper
gpt_wrapper = GPTWrapper(model_name="gpt-4o")

# Send a query with an image
result = gpt_wrapper.ask(
    image="examples/kettle.png", 
    text="What is this?"
)

# Access structured result
print(result)

# Display cost information
print(gpt_wrapper.show_cost())
```

## Customization

### Creating Custom Response Responses

You can create custom response responses by inheriting from `BaseModel` and adding the fields you want to include in the response.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class DetailedObjectResponse(BaseModel):
    name: str
    ... # other fields that you want to include in the response
```

Then, you can use the custom response when you are asking the GPT Wrapper:

```python
gpt_wrapper = GPTWrapper(model_name="gpt-4o")

gpt.ask(
    image="examples/kettle.png", 
    text="What is this?",
    response_format=DetailedObjectResponse,
)
```

### Custom System Prompts

Modify the system prompt in `gptwrapper/config/system_prompt.py` to customize the behavior:

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = "Analyze images and provide detailed information about objects."
```

### Adding more models

You should be able to use arbitrary models provided by OpenAI without modifying any code. However, for models that are not listed in `gptwrapper/models.py`, the cost tracking feature will not work.

Besides, to use Gemini, or other models that are not provided by OpenAI, you need to inherit a new model class from `BaseModel`, and add the following attributes in `gptwrapper/models.py`:

```python
class NewModel(BaseModel):
    name: str
    rates: tuple[float, float]
    base_url: str
```

where `name` is the name of the model, `rates` is a tuple of the form `(prompt_rate, completion_rate)`, and `base_url` is the base URL of the API.

#### Notes:

- If you are adding a new OpenAI's model, you don't need to add the `base_url` attribute. 
- If you are adding a new Gemini model, you need to add the `base_url` attribute, and set it to `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`.
- If you are using custom models, you need to add the `base_url` attribute, and set it to the base URL of the API.

## Cost Tracking
The wrapper automatically tracks token usage and costs following the rates provided by OpenAI & Google Cloud's official websites.

Access cost information:

```python
total_cost = gpt_wrapper.show_cost()
print(total_cost)
```

***Note: The cost tracking is not 100% accurate, as the price might vary. You should always check the latest price on the OpenAI & Google Cloud websites.***
